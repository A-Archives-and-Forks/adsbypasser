## Feature Request

All feature requests are welcome but may not always be accepted.

### How to Request a Feature

Typical types of feature requests:

* **New site:**  
  Provide a sample link.

* **New functionality:**  
  Explain why this feature is important.

---

## Pull Request

Send pull requests (PRs) to the `develop` branch.

Keep in mind:

* **Coding style:**  
  Follow consistent indentation. Using an editor with vim modeline support is recommended.

* **Reusing existing rules:**  
  Some sites share the same system (e.g., *adf.ly*, *linkbucks.com*, *bc.vc*).  
  If your site is similar to an existing one, update the URL rule instead of creating a new file.

* **One feature per commit:**  
  PRs adding multiple features in a single commit will be rejected. Split them into separate commits.
